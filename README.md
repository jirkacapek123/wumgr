# WuMgr

## Overview
WuManager (Update Manager for Windows) is a tool to manage updates of Microsoft products on the Windows operating system.
It uses the ["Windows Update Agent API"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wua_sdk/portal-client) to identify as well as download and install missing updates.
It allows the user fine control of updates on modern (Windows 10) operating system versions, comparable to what windows 7 and 8.1 offered.

This tool is inspired by the [Windows Update Mini Tool (WUMT)](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/windows_update_minitool.html), however in comparison to WUMT it is written in pure .NET instead of C/C++, and it is open source.
